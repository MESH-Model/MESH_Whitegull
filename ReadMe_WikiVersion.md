## General information

Basin/Domain name:
Location:
Steward:
Last updated:

## Basin Overview
Add an overview of the basin or domain, and surrounding domain, its location relative to political boundaries, maps or illustrations, description of topography, history of observation, unique qualities, whether the basin is heavily instrumented, etc.

## Hydrological Structures

### Outlet locations
Add outlets and/or hydrometric stations to the table. Include coordinates, an ID if available, if the station is active, if it contains streamflow and/or level data, length of record, if those data are suitable for calibration, etc.

Table of:
Name(ID), Coordinates, Status, Record Length, and notes

### Reservoirs or large water bodies
Add reservoirs, lakes, or other large water bodies to the table, as well as an significant flow control structures such as dams or weirs. Include coordinates for its outlet, an ID if available, an area that can be used for deriving release curves, etc. Only include static information. Information about a release curve and model-specific configuration should be placed in a setup-specific page.

Table of:
Name(ID), Coordinates at the outlet, notes

### Meteorological stations
Add any meteorological stations in the basin

## Available data
List all sources of information (whether or not they were used in the project), how they can be acquired and/or downloaded, if they've already been copied to a shared location, publication date, publication reference, and other information for such products as climate data, DEMs, land cover data, soils data, etc., in list or table format. If multiple sources exist, separate the data into sections, such as 'Climate Data', 'DEM', 'Land Cover', 'Soils', 'Measured Data', etc.

Add table; columns:
Data Type (climate data, streamflow, DEM, landcover, soils, measured data, etc; would be good to have a dropdown list for this column)

Source / publication reference

Publication date

Storage Location

Details (i.e. climate variables available, data frequency or areal coverage, other information)

Used?
*State whether or not used in the project, and why / why not*
