List of changes
---------------

1. The reservoir release table is now read from the reservoir release file when
   'Coeff1' of Lake Nipigon  (b1(6) in the code) is zero in the same file. 

   S/R: read_resv_ef.f  (March 11, 2010)


2. Fixed bug in 'read_resv_ef.f'. Line 

       if(qrel(k,ktr).lt.0.0)qrel(k,ktr)=0.001

   was replaced by

       if(qrel(k,1).lt.0.0) qrel(k,1)=0.001


3. Currently, WATROUTE is run daily and it reads the same monthly reservoir 
   release file every day of a given month. A change has been made so that 
   WATROUTE can now select the release corresponding to the current hour and 
   day of the month from the hourly reservoir release array (qrel), which is 
   set using daily releases from the monthly file.

   S/R: rerout.f  (March 12, 2010)


4. Corrected initial lake level for lake Ontario, which is hard-coded in 
   rerout.f (January 2011)


5. Added code for streamflow insertion. (March 2011)

6. Added support for RPN-standard-format (.fst) input/output for recharge,
   runoff, watershed/parameter (shed/par), grid_flow, and flowinit files.
   This support is enabled by using an event-file of version 9.8 or greater
   and setting 'fstflg' to 'y'.  (Using a 9.7-version event file or having
   'fstflg' set to anything other than 'y' will disable fst-I/O and fall
   back to the existing codebase.)

   This change is untested with (and probably breaks) wetland routing.
