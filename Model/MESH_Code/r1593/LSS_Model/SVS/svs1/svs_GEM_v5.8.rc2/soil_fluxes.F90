!Object
!     Calculate the flux of water between soil layers
!     based on soil characteristics and liquid water content
!     using the Brooks and Corey model and updates the water content
!     this function uses a Euler forward 1st order method to solve
!     for water content at the end of the time step but can be embedded
!     in a Runge-Kutta algorithm to increase the order of the scheme
!
!Arguments
!
!          - INPUT -
!
! DT                model time step used in the computation of F [s]
!
!          --- Soil characteristics (near saturation) for each layer ---
!
! WSATC (NL_SVS)    volumetric water content at soil saturation per layer [m3/m3]
! KSATC (NL_SVS)    vertical hydraulic conductivity at saturation per layer [m/s]
! PSISAT(NL_SVS)    value of soil water suction at air-entry (near saturation) per layer [m]
! BCOEF (NL_SVS)    slope of the retention curve per layer
!
!          --- Source/sink terms ---
!
! ETR_GRID(NL_SVS)  evapotranspiration rate for each layer, grid box average [m/s]
!
!          --- Current water content for each layer ---
!
! WD (NL_SVS)       soil volumetric water content (per layer) [m3/m3]
!
!          -  INPUT/OUTPUT  -
!
! F (NL_SVS+1)      total flux of water between each layer and at top and bottom boundaries during time step [m]
!                   initially, contains three values:
!                   F(1):       infiltration coming in at the top of the soil column
!                   F(NL_SVS+1):baseflow at the bottom of the soil column
!                   these three values are unchanged by this subroutine, which fills in the other values
!                   * THESE THREE VALUES OF F NEED TO BE PROPERLY INITIALIZED BY THE CALLING SUBROUTINE *
!
!          -  OUTPUT  -
!
!          --- Water content and flux of water between layers (volumetric) ---
!
! WDT (NL_SVS)      water content in each layer at the end of the time step [m3/m3]
! DWD (NL_SVS)      change in storage in each layer based on flux F for a time step DT [m3/m3]
! OVRSHT (NL_SVS)   overshoot correction required to keep WDT within physical bounds [m3/m3]
!                   this amount of water needs to be reallocated to maintain the water balance
!
!          ---  Diagnostic Soil Parameters (used only for testing SVS) ---
!
! KHC (NL_SVS-1)    soil hydraulic conductivity at soil boundaries (of layer) [m/s]
