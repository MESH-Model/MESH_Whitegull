   !    Initial WATDRN code derived from WAT_DRAIN by Ric Soulis
   !    Code entirely rewritten for three main reasons:
   !    - simplify the parameterization by working with average
   !      hydraulic conductivity within a layer (runs faster, but
   !      more importantly is easier to understand for users)
   !    - meet CCC and RPN source code standards
   !    - improve readability

   !    - Define grkeff as ksat * (tile slope / tile length) (1/s)
   !      (take out thpor, as thpor changes with ice content)
   !    - Modify computation of critical time accordingly:
   !      tc = thpor / (c*grkeff)

   !    - Stop computing t0 and t1 to avoid overflow, compute tc/t
   !      directly when t>tc and t/tc when t<tc (where t=t0 or t1)
   !    - Avoid dividing by tc to make the code more robust
   !      when tc is small
   !    - Simplify calculation of baseflow rate
   !    - Bugfix: move satsfc calculation after computation of tc/t0
   !    - Change variable name from thpor to thpora

   !    - asatfc (saturation at field capacity) added as an input

   !      if asatfc is set to zero this change has no impact

   !  Summary:
   !
   !  This routine calculates the outflow from a tilted landscape
   !  element (tile). Rather than using average saturation for the
   !  element(asat0), it finds flow using the saturation at the
   !  seepage face (for interflow) at at the bottom of the layer
   !  (for baseflow). The routine returns:
   !  1) the saturation at the end of the time step (asat1)
   !  2) the interflow (subflw) and baseflow (basflw) integrated
   !     over the duration of the time step (in m)
   !  3) the fraction of the surface which is saturated at the
   !     surface according to the model (satsfc)
   !
   !  Interflow amount during the time step in m is determined from:
   !  subflw = (asat0 - asat1) * thpor * delzw
   !  (implicit estimation)
   !
   !  Baseflow amount during the time step in m is determined from:
   !  basflw = grksat * asatb0**(2*bcoef+3) * delt
   !  where asatb0 is the average saturation across the bottom of the
   !  element at initial time (explicit estimation, 1st order)
   !
   !  The fraction of the surface that is saturated at the initial
   !  time (satsfc) is estimated as MIN(1-t0/tc,0) where t0 is the
   !  (theoretical) time elapsed since saturation and tc is the
   !  critical time at which the saturation front reaches the
   !  seepage face.

   !  Background info on WATDRN:
   !
   !  WATDRN is a parameterization for sub-grid scale interflow,
   !  i.e. subsurface flow, which is thought to be an important flow
   !  generation process following a rain event at the basin scale
   !
   !  The underlying principles behind WATDRN are described in
   !  a paper by Soulis et al. (2000), Atmosphere-Ocean.
   !  However, this code presents a simpler solution to the problem
   !  which assumes that hydraulic conductivity is constant within
   !  a soil layer. This is a departure from previous versions of
   !  WATDRN aimed at making the code easier to understand
   !  and faster to run.
   !
   !  Here is the basic idea: interflow is especially important
   !  after a rain event which leaves the soil close to saturation.
   !  Following such a rain event, water flows from the hillslope
   !  to the river which creates a gradient in water content along
   !  the hillslope. But land-surface models have generally as their
   !  prognostic variable the mean water content of the grid box.
   !  Under the hypothesis of Darcian flow along the hillslope
   !  following a rain event which left the soil saturated, WATDRN
   !  recovers the saturation distribution along the hillslope
   !  from the bulk saturation, estimates from this the interflow
   !  rate at the seepage face and integrates this rate over the
   !  duration of the time step.
   !
   !  Given a bulk saturation value asat_t0 at the start of the
   !  time step, and assuming that this bulk saturation is the
   !  result of Darcian flow in the direction of the hillslope
   !  starting from a saturated soil (with no rain after that),
   !  there is a one-to-one relationship between bulk saturation
   !  and the time elapsed since the rain stopped. So we can figure
   !  out:
   !
   !  1. t0, the (theoretical) time elapsed since the soil was
   !     saturated, knowing the bulk saturation asat0.
   !  2. t1, the (theoretical) time at the end of the time step
   !     (that's just t0+delt)
   !  3. asat1, the bulk saturation at the end of the time step
   !
   !  Then interflow is proportional to the difference between
   !  asat0 and asat1.
   !
   !  From bulk saturation, it is also possible to figure out
   !  average saturation across the bottom of the element, which
   !  is used to estimate baseflow, and the fraction of the surface
   !  that is saturated, which can be used to separate runoff and
   !  infiltration.
   !
   !  This parameterization does not take succion into account.
   !  Hence, water content can drop to non-physical values during
   !  a drought. As a sanity check, water content at the end of
   !  the time step is not allowed to drop below lateral field
   !  capacity.
