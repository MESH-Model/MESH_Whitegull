This directory contains the source code for the runsvs driver,
as well as source code that was modified from the official svs code.

These two subroutines were modified to use lookup tables for LAI:
inicover_svs.ftn90
inisoili_svs.ftn90

This is the main program which includes the time loop:
runsvs.ftn90

This function is used to initialize state variables that are not set elsewhere.
It needs to be adapted to fit your need, depending on what gets done in runsvs_io.ftn90:
runsvs_init.ftn90

This module contains I/O functions to read configuration and forcing files, as well as write outputs.
It should be adapted to fit your needs. The vanilla version works with CLASS-style benchmark files.
runsvs_io.ftn90

This module contains the definition of all of the bus variables used by SVS.
It is normally generated automatically by the scripts located in the bin directory,
and needs to be updated when the bus variables used by SVS change.
runsvs_mod.ftn90

This module contains a few simple utility functions that are used by the driver.
It also defines the variables that are part of the namelist 
runsvs_utils.ftn90
