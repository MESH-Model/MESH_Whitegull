c       Initial WATDRN code derived from WAT_DRAIN by Ric Soulis
c       Code entirely rewritten for three main reasons:
c       - simplify the parameterization by working with average
c         hydraulic conductivity within a layer (runs faster, but
c         more importantly is easier to understand for users)
c       - meet CCC and RPN source code standards
c       - improve readability
c
c     * December 11, 2009, Vincent Fortin
c
c       - Define grkeff as ksat * (tile slope / tile length) (1/s)
c         (take out thpor, as thpor changes with ice content)
c       - Modify computation of critical time accordingly:
c         tc = thpor / (c*grkeff)

c
c       - Stop computing t0 and t1 to avoid overflow, compute tc/t
c         directly when t>tc and t/tc when t<tc (where t=t0 or t1)
c       - Avoid dividing by tc to make the code more robust
c         when tc is small
c       - Simplify calculation of baseflow rate
c       - Bugfix: move satsfc calculation after computation of tc/t0
c       - Change variable name from thpor to thpora

c     Summary:
c
c     This routine calculates the outflow from a tilted landscape
c     element (tile). Rather than using average saturation for the 
c     element(asat0), it finds flow using the saturation at the
c     seepage face (for interflow) at at the bottom of the layer
c     (for baseflow). The routine returns:
c     1) the saturation at the end of the time step (asat1)
c     2) the interflow (subflw) and baseflow (basflw) integrated 
c        over the duration of the time step (in m)
c     3) the fraction of the surface which is saturated at the
c        surface according to the model (satsfc)
c
c     Interflow amount during the time step in m is determined from:
c     subflw = (asat0 - asat1) * thpor * delzw
c     (implicit estimation)
c
c     Baseflow amount during the time step in m is determined from:
c     basflw = grksat * asatb0**(2*bcoef+3) * delt
c     where asatb0 is the average saturation across the bottom of the
c     element at initial time (explicit estimation, 1st order)
c
c     The fraction of the surface that is saturated at the initial
c     time (satsfc) is estimated as MIN(1-t0/tc,0) where t0 is the 
c     (theoretical) time elapsed since saturation and tc is the
c     critical time at which the saturation front reaches the
c     seepage face.
c
c     Background info on WATDRN:
c
c     WATDRN is a parameterization for sub-grid scale interflow,
c     i.e. subsurface flow, which is thought to be an important flow
c     generation process following a rain event at the basin scale
c
c     The underlying principles behind WATDRN are described in
c     a paper by Soulis et al. (2000), Atmosphere-Ocean.
c     However, this code presents a simpler solution to the problem
c     which assumes that hydraulic conductivity is constant within
c     a soil layer. This is a departure from previous versions of
c     WATDRN aimed at making the code easier to understand
c     and faster to run.
c
c     Here is the basic idea: interflow is especially important
c     after a rain event which leaves the soil close to saturation.
c     Following such a rain event, water flows from the hillslope
c     to the river which creates a gradient in water content along
c     the hillslope. But land-surface models have generally as their
c     prognostic variable the mean water content of the grid box.
c     Under the hypothesis of Darcian flow along the hillslope
c     following a rain event which left the soil saturated, WATDRN
c     recovers the saturation distribution along the hillslope
c     from the bulk saturation, estimates from this the interflow
c     rate at the seepage face and integrates this rate over the
c     duration of the time step.
c
c     Given a bulk saturation value asat_t0 at the start of the
c     time step, and assuming that this bulk saturation is the
c     result of Darcian flow in the direction of the hillslope
c     starting from a saturated soil (with no rain after that),
c     there is a one-to-one relationship between bulk saturation
c     and the time elapsed since the rain stopped. So we can figure
c     out:
c
c     1. t0, the (theoretical) time elapsed since the soil was
c        saturated, knowing the bulk saturation asat0.
c     2. t1, the (theoretical) time at the end of the time step
c        (that's just t0+delt)
c     3. asat1, the bulk saturation at the end of the time step
c
c     Then interflow is proportional to the difference between
c     asat0 and asat1.
c
c     From bulk saturation, it is also possible to figure out
c     average saturation across the bottom of the element, which
c     is used to estimate baseflow, and the fraction of the surface
c     that is saturated, which can be used to separate runoff and
c     infiltration.
