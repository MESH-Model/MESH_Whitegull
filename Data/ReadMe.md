# Raw Data
This folder contains the raw data used in the project. Due to its large storage size, it is not tracked by git or stored on GitHub. Rather, it is stored on the Graham server and on the local machine (if desired).

To download the raw data:
- Open the "pullRawData.sh" file in a text editor
- Change the Graham user name to your own
- Remove or add the "--dry-run" flag, as warranted
- Run the script from the command line. This will pull the raw data files from the server to your local machine.

If new raw data files are to be added to Graham, use the "pushRawData.sh" file in the same manner.
