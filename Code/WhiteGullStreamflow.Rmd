This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(tidyhydat)
```

```{r}
# Obtain the station number for the White Gull Creek streamflow station

StnNum <- pull_station_number(search_stn_name("White Gull"))
StnNum

# Plot realtime data

Whitegull_realtime <- realtime_dd(StnNum)
plot(Whitegull_realtime)

# Plot historical data

Whitegull_hist <- hy_daily_flows(StnNum)
plot(Whitegull_hist)

# Annual Statistics

Whitegull_stats <- hy_annual_stats(StnNum)

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
